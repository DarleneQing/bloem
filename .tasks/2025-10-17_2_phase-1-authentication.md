# Task Description
Implement Phase 1: Authentication & User Management - Complete authentication system with user profiles and seller activation. This includes email/password auth, Google OAuth, user profile management, seller activation with IBAN, and all related UI components.

# Project Overview
Bloem is a circular fashion marketplace web application. Phase 1 focuses on building the authentication foundation that will support all user types (buyers, sellers, admins) with a single user model where sellers activate by providing IBAN information.

# Analysis
**Current State:**
- Phase 0 complete: Next.js 14, Supabase clients, database schema, RLS policies
- Database has profiles table with IBAN fields for seller activation
- Supabase Auth configured with Email provider
- Auth middleware already set up
- No auth UI components yet
- No server actions for auth operations

**Phase 1 Components (7 sections):**
1.1. Supabase Authentication Setup
1.2. Resend Email Integration
1.3. User Profile Entity & Operations (server actions + queries)
1.4. Authentication UI Components (sign-up, sign-in, OAuth callback, reset)
1.5. Profile Management UI (profile page, seller activation)
1.6. Auth Helper Components (protected routes, seller gates)
1.7. Role Management (admin utilities)

**Key Requirements:**
- Single user type with seller activation model
- Email/Password + Google OAuth
- Profile created automatically on signup (via trigger)
- Seller activation requires IBAN information
- All authenticated users can buy; activated sellers can sell
- Admin role for platform management
