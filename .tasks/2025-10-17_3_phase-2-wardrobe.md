# Task Description
Implement Phase 2: Digital Wardrobe & Item Management - Enable ALL users to create their digital wardrobe with full CRUD operations. Non-activated users can display/share items. Activated sellers can prepare items for selling by moving them to RACK and setting selling prices.

# Project Overview
Bloem is a circular fashion marketplace. Phase 2 focuses on building the digital wardrobe feature that allows all users to upload and manage their clothing items. Items have different statuses (WARDROBE_PUBLIC, WARDROBE_PRIVATE, RACK, LISTED, SOLD) and users can control privacy and selling readiness.

# Analysis
**Current State:**
- Phase 1 complete: Full authentication system with seller activation
- Bottom navigation ready with Wardrobe tab
- Wardrobe page shows empty state
- Database schema has items table with all required fields
- Supabase Storage buckets configured (items-images-full, items-images-thumbnails)
- Image compression library installed (browser-image-compression)

**Phase 2 Components (10 sections):**
2.1. Item Validation Schemas
2.2. Image Upload Utilities
2.3. Item Operations (Server Actions)
2.4. Item Query Functions
2.5. Wardrobe UI - Main Page
2.6. Item Upload UI
2.7. Item Detail & Edit UI
2.8. Item Edit UI
2.9. Public Wardrobe Profile
2.10. Item Components

**Key Requirements:**
- ALL users can upload items (not just sellers)
- Image compression: full 1920px max 2MB, thumbnail 400px max 100KB
- 1-5 images per item, max 5MB each
- Title 3-200 chars, Description 20-500 chars
- Selling price €1-€1000 (only when moving to RACK)
- Non-sellers: WARDROBE_PUBLIC ⟷ WARDROBE_PRIVATE
- Sellers add: WARDROBE → RACK → LISTED → SOLD
- Cannot delete items if LISTED or SOLD

# Proposed Solution
## Architecture
- **Validation Layer**: Zod schemas for type-safe input validation
- **Storage Layer**: Supabase Storage with automated image compression
- **Data Layer**: Server actions for CRUD operations with RLS enforcement
- **Query Layer**: Server-side data fetching with filtering
- **UI Layer**: Component-based architecture with reusable elements

## Key Features Implemented
1. **ALL Users Can Upload Items** - No seller activation required for basic wardrobe
2. **Image Management** - Compression (full 1920px, thumbnail 400px) with upload progress
3. **Item Status Flow** - WARDROBE_PUBLIC ⟷ WARDROBE_PRIVATE ⟷ RACK ⟷ LISTED ⟷ SOLD
4. **Privacy Controls** - Toggle public/private visibility
5. **Seller Features** - Move items to RACK with selling price (€1-€1000)
6. **CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete (with status restrictions)
7. **Public Profiles** - View other users' public wardrobes
8. **Tabs & Filters** - Organize items by status with stats
9. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first with grid layouts
10. **Real-time Validation** - Client and server-side validation
