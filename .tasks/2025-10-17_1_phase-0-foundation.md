# Task Description
Implement Phase 0: Project Foundation - Complete technical foundation for the Bloem circular fashion marketplace MVP. This includes Next.js project setup, Tailwind CSS & Shadcn UI configuration, Supabase integration, complete database schema with migrations, RLS policies, and all required dependencies.

# Project Overview
Bloem is a circular fashion marketplace web application that organizes pop-up flea markets with digital labeling solutions for second-hand clothing. Built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase, and Adyen payments. The platform enables sellers to list items at physical markets using QR codes, and buyers to scan and purchase items seamlessly.
